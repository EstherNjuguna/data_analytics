## Introduction

Suicide is the act or an instance of taking one's own life voluntarily and intentionally (Meriam-Webster Dictionary).

According to WHO, More than 700 000 persons die by suicide every year globally. Suicide is the fourth leading cause of death among 15-29 year olds.
This is a power Bi project on suicide global rates. The aim of the project is to analyse and derive insights with regards to suicide and see how we can help resolve the menace.
